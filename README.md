# Random-Anime-Poster-Generator
## Why I Created It
<p>This project was an intro to using API's for me. For an assesssment with CodeFirstGirls I was tasked with finding an api to use and utelising  in a creative way. I opted to continue following the anime theme from my previous project and decided to explore the MyAnimeList API. From there I decided to create an project that would randomly generate an anime name along with a link to it's correspondiing poster. This project was a fun way to consolidate all of the python knowledge that i had accumulated so far.</p>
