# Random-Anime-Poster-Generator
## Why I Created It
<p>This project was an intro to using API's for me. I opted to continue following the anime theme from my previous project and decided to explore the MyAnimeList API. From there I decided to create an project that would randomly generate an anime name along with a link to it's correspondiing poster. This project was a fun way to consolidate all of the python knowledge that i had accumulated so far.</p>

__How to Use It__
<p>TThis script is straightforward and only requires the installation of `requests` version 2.31. To simplify the installation process, a `requirements.txt` file is provided. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When all dependencies have been installed, you can run the code from the random_anime_poster_generator.py, and the anime title and poster link will be printed into the results_file.txt</p>
